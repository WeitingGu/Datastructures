> The data frame we are going to explore today is nba_draft_2015 (Projecting The Top 50 Players In The 2015 NBA Draft Class).

For what NBA stands for, see the footnote[^1] .
```{r force = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight")
library(fivethirtyeight)
```

nba_draft_2015 from fivethrityeight is basically the raw data behind the story ["Projecting The Top 50 Players In The 2015 NBA Draft Class"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/projecting-the-top-50-players-in-the-2015-nba-draft-class/). An analysis using this data was contributed by G. Elliott Morris as a [package vignette](http://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.com/articles/nba.html).

It is a data frame with 1090 rows representing National Basketball Association players/prospects and 9 variables.
Here we can find some descriptions about the variables.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
variable_name <- c("player", "position", "id", "draft_year", "projected_spm", "superstar", "starter", "role_player", "bust")
variable_description <- c("Player name","The player's position","The player's identification code","The year the player was eligible for the NBA draft","projected statistical -/+ over yrs 2-5 of NBA career", "Probability of becoming a superstar player ", "Probability of becoming a starting-caliber player", "Probability of becoming a role player","Probability of becoming a bust")
variables_df <- data.frame(variable_name, variable_description)
variables_df

```
### Here is a summary of the data frame:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(nba_draft_2015)
```
### Here is an interactive and a non-interative table of the data frame:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# install.packages("DT")
library(DT)
datatable(nba_draft_2015)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# install.packages("knitr")
library(knitr)
kable(nba_draft_2015[1:15,], row.names = NA, col.names = NA)
```

### Equation:
In this data dataframe we can do some simple calculations. 
If we know the bust data (A person's probability of becoming a bust), then the equation$Nonbust = 1 - bust$ would help us to know the a person's probability of not becoming a bust.

### Plotting:
Here we could draw a histogram of players' probability of becoming a bust.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
hist(nba_draft_2015$bust)
```

### By the way...
By the way, who is your favorite NBA star?

Mine is Stephen Curry:)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Stephen_Curry.jpg")
```

#### Now we have finish our exploration of the data frame. Great job!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/WOW.jpg")
```
